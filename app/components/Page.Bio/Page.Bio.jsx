            In the foggy San Francisco summer of 2014, Juan Martinez met Noah Appel, and together the emcee, drummer duo started what would become Sonny Ruckus.
            As the peieces started to come toether - Joe Ferrone on trumpet, Scott Mayhew on guitar, Clare Nauman on violin, Kaila Love emcee/vocals, and Colin Bjorklund on bass -
            the sound started to form. Sonny Ruckus found it's indentity blending a fresh mix of Hip-Hop, Funk, and Dance, and is here to unleash it on you.
